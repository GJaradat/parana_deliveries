## Introduction
The aim of this project is to create a logistics application for a (fictional) online retailer called Paran√°. The main features are managing vehicles and deliveries, and generating routes for distribution of deliveries. Routes are generated dynamically based on the locations of deliveries, with the help of MapBox Optimisation API v1. This was created as a final project for the 13th cohort of the [Bright Network Technology Academy](https://techacademy.brightnetwork.co.uk/).

## Technology
Purpose of Technology usage: The objective is to enhance learning and skill development as an integral component of the bootcamp experience hence why the following technologies were used.
### Tech Stack
- Java
- SpringBoot
- PostgreSQL Database
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- React

### SpringBoot Configuration:
- Maven Project
- Spring Boot: Ver. 3.2.3
- Spring Boot Dev Tools
- Spring Web
- PostgreSQL Driver
- Spring Data JPA

### React Libraries Used:
- react-router-dom
- react-modal

### External APIs Used
1. [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) to display the maps and display markers of the delivery locations.
2. [Optimization API v1](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/navigation/optimization-v1/#example-request-retrieve-an-optimization) to calculate the shortest distance of a given route.

For a tutorial of the MapBox GL JS API, click [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/use-mapbox-gl-js-with-react/).

## Installation Instructions
- In the terminal, navigate to the directory you want to copy the repository into. 
- Run the command `git clone git@github.com:GJaradat/parana_deliveries.git`.
- Run the command `git pull` to ensure you have the latest version.
  
**backend setup**
1. Install Postman, Postico, PostgreSQL, and (optional)your preferred IDE.
2. In the terminal, navigate to the server directory.
3. Run the command `createdb deliveries_db` to create the linked database.
4. Run the command `./mvnw spring-boot:run` to run the server.
5. Open Postman.(*Optional:* Import the `Parana Deliveries.postman_collection.json` file into your Postman to access all of the repo endpoints with example payloads.) 
6. On Postman, make a ```POST``` request to the ```http://localhost:8080/routes/generateRoutes``` endpoint. 

**frontend setup**
1. Download Node.js.
2. Create an access token on the MapBox website (for instructions on this, click [here](https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-generate-mapbox-access-tokens)).
3. Open the client directory in your preferred IDE (we used VSCode).
4. In the client folder, create an `.env` file.
5. In the .env file, paste the code `REACT_APP_MAPBOX_KEY = [your mapbox access key here]`.
6. In the terminal, run the commands `npm i` and `npm i mapbox-gl` to download all of the dependencies.
7. Run the command `npm start`to open the frontend application.

  - User can add a new vehicle 
- Delivery Routes Page: localhost:3000/routes
  - Use maps to visualise the individual routes
  - Map points are colour coded based on the status of the delivery
- Delivery Page: localhost:3000/deliveries
  - User can view all deliveries on a map
  - Map points are colour coded based on the status of the delivery
 
  ## COMING SOON
 **(Backend)**
 - Delete vehicles
 - Add/Delete vehicles based on demand
