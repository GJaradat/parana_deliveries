## Introduction
The aim of this project is to create a logistics application for a (fictional) online retailer called Paran√°. The main features are managing vehicles and deliveries, and generating routes for distribution of deliveries. Routes are generated dynamically based on the locations of deliveries, with the help of MapBox Optimisation API v1. This was created as a final project for the 13th cohort of the [Bright Network Technology Academy](https://techacademy.brightnetwork.co.uk/).

## Technology
Purpose of Technology usage: The objective is to enhance learning and skill development as an integral component of the bootcamp experience hence why the following technologies were used.
### Tech Stack
- Java
- SpringBoot
- PostgreSQL Database
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- React

### SpringBoot Configuration:
- Maven Project
- Spring Boot: Ver. 3.2.3
- Spring Boot Dev Tools
- Spring Web
- PostgreSQL Driver
- Spring Data JPA

### React Libraries Used:
- react-router-dom
- *react-modal(?)*

### External APIs Used
1. [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) to display the maps which can display markers of delivery locations.
2. [Optimization API v1](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/navigation/optimization-v1/#example-request-retrieve-an-optimization) to calculate the shortest distance of a given route.

Please note that to use these APIs you need to create an account on the Mapbox website and create an access token. 
For instructions on generating a token, click [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/use-mapbox-gl-js-with-react/).

## Installation Instructions
- In the terminal, navigate to the directory you want to copy the repository into. 
- Run the command `git clone git@github.com:GJaradat/parana_deliveries.git`
- Run the command `git pull` to ensure you have the latest version.
  
(backend setup)
1. Install Postman, Postico, PostgreSQL, and your preferred IDE.
2. Open the server directory in your preferred IDE (we used IntelliJ).
3. In the terminal, create the linked database by running the command `createdb deliveries_db`.
4. Run the server.

(frontend setup)
1. Download Node.js.
2. Open the client directory in your preferred IDE (we used VSCode).
3. In the client folder, create the file .env
4. In the .env file paste the code `REACT_APP_MAPBOX_KEY = [your mapbox access key here]`.
5. In the terminal, run the command `npm i`.
6. In the terminal, run the command `npm i mapbox-gl`.
7. Run the frontend application by entering the command `npm start` in the termainal.
